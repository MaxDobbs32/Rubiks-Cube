# Rubiks-Cube
A Rubik's Cube Simulator and AI made in Python

This code contains a program that displays and solves a Rubik's Cube. It runs in Python using the Tkinter and Random modules, and any mathematics relating to the 3D projection are performed within the program. Quaternions are used to rotate the entire cube as well as its individual sides. If you want to gain a better understand of how the program works, I suggest reading the file with commentary added. The code contains many failsafes to prevent crashing and other errors, but if you notice any issues feel free to contact me. To download the python files, please visit maxdobbs.itch.io/rubiks-cube
